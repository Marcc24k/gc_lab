 Grand Circus Day one lab.
 
Ok, well I learned a great lesson today! Try and keep CSS to ONE file! I now see why it is so important to build with the technique. I found 
it very difficult to edit my responsiveness to my pages because I was making multiple @mediaqueries achieve something I could have done once.
Unfortunately, I was unable to merge all of my other CSS files due to of lack of time. So, I pushed forward and worked around this problem for now. 
For future projects, I'll remember this frustrating situation.  hhhhhhhhhhhhhh.........
